## Layout
The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

## note
- The website design and materials like images, design, colors, etc is from the font end mentor website. I just use all the resources that the website provided to create a copy for my own, they also allow me to use in in my portfolio as soon as i give credit to their website. I apply some of the skills i gained like animation, transtion, proper layout, different units, sass, intersection observer, and many more.
